            Pour the coffee beans into a pan and roast them golden brown over
            hot coals. To prevent the beans from burning quickly, it is recommended 
            not to stay in one spot but to move the pan gently back and forth.
            Alternatively, a stove can also be used instead of coals.</h2>

            Ground the coffe until the texture is powdery. Traditionally, this is done 
            by hand, but you can also make it more comfortable by putting 
            the coffee beans in a blender.</h2>

            Pour the ground coffee powder into the coffee pot *Jebena* 
            and add some water. To determine if enough water has been added, 
            you can simply shake the *Jebena* from left to right. 
            Shake until the texture sounds watery or thin.</h2>

            Heat the coffee over the fire for a few minutes. When the coffee 
            boils to the point of bubbling up to the opening of the *Jebena*, pour some of that coffee into 
            a small container and then back into the original vessel. Now, allow the 
            coffee to cool off for a few minutes.</h2>

            Pour the finished coffee carefully into the coffee cups *Fenajil*.
            To complement the taste, popcorn and pastries such as
            *Himbascha* and *Kitscha* are usually served alongside.</h2>
